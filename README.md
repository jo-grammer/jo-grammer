### <p align="center"> Hi There! I'm Jô 👋 </p>

<p align="center"> Welcome to my GitHub ! </p>

<p align="center">I'm a self-taught Data Scientist/Analyst with a keen enthusiasm for Python programming, spoken languages and how we can derive meaning from data in order to make decisions from it. I also enjoy investigating mysteries, reading books, learning constantly, taking a step back, and finding that “a ha!” moment when I see the big picture. </p>
